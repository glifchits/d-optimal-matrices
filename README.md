## D-optimal matrices

This repository contains code for my research project, in which I intend to
investigate how quantum algorithms can speed up the search for D-optimal
sequences.

### Notes (to self)

* Accounting module can store tasks in a tree, to represent how tasks are
  subtasks of one another (this would be nice)

* I intend to implement pushing the running time statistics to a Google
  spreadsheet.

  * Should save the Git revision hash of the program in the spreadsheet

  * Should ensure that the Git tree is clean before running the program (that
    way we can ensure that the statistics will be properly documented)
